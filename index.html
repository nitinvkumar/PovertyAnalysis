    <P>I assembled this dataset to see if there is a correlation between a state’s poverty rate, and the amount of poorest cities that the state contains. Poorest city is a list of  rankings of 105 cities, from greatest to least, that have a large percentage of people who live below the poverty line. <span class='green'>Green</span> dots are states with a lower ranking, and less poverty percentage, <span class= "yellow">yellow</span> dots are in the middle, and <span class="red">red</span> dots have the highest percentage of people living below the poverty line. One would expect that the states with a higher poverty rate would contain cities who are on this list, but this is often not the case. For example, Mississippi who has an above average poverty rating of 23%, has no cities on this list. New Jersey on the other hand, with a poverty rating of just 10%, has 2 cities on this list: Newark which comes in at number <span class="red">9</span>, and Jersey city which is at <span class="green">84</span>.</p>  

<p>What this data shows is that the poverty rate of the state does not directly impact the the ranking of the most impoverished city. Rather, impoverished cities are related more by population, and by <strong> proximity </strong> to one another. The map above shows how lots of the  <span class="red">red</span>  dots are located closer to each other. Therefore, it is easy to spot regional, interstate, trends in terms of poverty<p>
  <p>
	I created this Fusion table by combining a state polygon shape file from the US census.gov website, and from poverty rate data that was also on the census website. I used shpescape.com to prepare the shape file as a fusion table, and I put the poverty rate dataset also in a fusion table. I then merged these tables together, and I modified the info window by deleting the data I did not need. I then set the feature style to a gradient, and had the color shade reflect poverty rate in the state. After that, I collected poverty ranking data, and put that into a separate fusion table. I changed the feature styles so that there would be 3 “buckets” or dots, and I set the range to reflect the range in my dataset. I then assigned colors to the buckets that reflect the severity of the poverty ranking for that city.
</p>

<p>Since you can only merge two tables together, I used the Google Fusion Layering Wizard to apply the merged map data as one layer, and the poverty ranking data as the next, which layered it on top of the map.</p>
